I wanted to kick things off with an introductory post to explain a little about where I am coming from, bear with me as my writing skills are far more technical than prose.

When I started at JAMF over two years ago I was only the second member of DevOps, making it an actual team.  At that time we relied on SVN to handle the source code and Jenkins to handle the builds.  The engineering team was significantly smaller than it is today, and this system began feeling constrained for where the Engineering department wanted to be heading.

Over the course of these last few years we have since migrated from SVN to Git and our team has added a few more members.  We transitioned from Trello, SVN, and Jenkins to leveraging Jira, Stash, and Bamboo.  These tools helped create a solid foundation from which our Engineering team could function more effectively, and give better insights of progress to the rest of the organization.  The journey to these toolsets was challenging, but we are now at a point where we have the capacity, knowledge, and toolset to find further effeciencies in our infrastucture and processes.

One of the most interesting technologies of the last few years (and source of posts to follow) is Docker.  Since discovering Docker early last year I have been driven to leverge the technology across our Engineering stack.  To say that people within JAMF associate me with Docker or vice versa would be an understatement.
![A Post-it note](/assets/images/postit.jpg)
Abstracting the tedious system administration tasks away from build agents and into source code controlled Dockerfiles backed by Bamboo builds and hosted internally within Artifactory has become a cornerstone of our build platform.  These resources have additonally provided an excellent platform to create a self-service application enabling users throughout the organization to spin up Docker contained release and branch builds on demand.  Where once a developer, QA, technical communications, product owner, etc... would all be managing a local virtual machine, downloading, and loading branch build artifacts, the application handles this task through CoreOS and Docker containers to lower the barrier of sharing, reuse, and technical knowlege required.

Through this blog I want to discuss how the DevOps team at JAMF is using these tools to tackle some of the problems facing any software company, faster iterations, higher quality software, and better support of customers.
