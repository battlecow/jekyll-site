### The Source

For the past several years I have been working as a DevOps Engineer at [JAMF Software](http://www.jamfsoftware.com/about/ "JAMF Software"){:target="_blank"}.

My current role at JAMF involves helping to scale the build infrastucture and providing a custom Docker orchestrator for pre-production branch builds.
